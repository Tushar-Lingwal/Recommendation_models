# Content-Based Song Recommendation SystemðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ
## Overview
The Content-Based Song Recommendation System is a Python application that utilizes a content-based filtering approach to recommend songs. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, which allows users to select a song and receive recommendations based on the textual content of song lyrics. The system leverages the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to compute recommendations.

## Features

- Main Interface: A user-friendly interface where users can:
    - Select a song from a dropdown list.
    - Filter the dropdown list by artist.
    - Get song recommendations based on the selected song.
    - View recommendations in a scrollable frame.
- Content-Based Filtering: The recommendation engine uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest similar songs based on lyrics.
